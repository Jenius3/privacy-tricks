# Privacy Checkup
Privacy measures, tricks, and tipps to protect the personal privacy in a digital environment as far as possible. 
Mainly based on the books "The Art of Invisibility" by Kevin Mitnick and the the Podcast "The Privacy, Security, &amp; OSINT Show".

## Privacy Mindset
* be sceptical
* understand the business model
* use as few services/apps/software as possible
* no system is 100% secure
* keep everything seperate

## Privacy Measures (unsorted and uncategorized, example realizations follow)
* [ ] use a VPN to connect to the Internet
 * e.g. ProtonVPN
  * [ ] #paranoid: use different VPN service providers (if one has a breach)
* [ ] install updates frequently
* [ ] disable camera (front/back, smartTV, smartphone)
* [ ] disable microphone (smartTV, smartphone)
* [ ] use several email addresses
 * e.g. ProtonMail, tutanota
* [ ] use burner mail services for newsletters/junk
 * e.g. 33mail.com, simplelogin.io
* [ ] use local backups
* [ ] use a password manager
 * e.g. KeePass XC
* [ ] use different randomly generated passwords for different accounts/services/...
* [ ] use a local or encrypted calendar
* [ ] use end-to-end(E2E)-encrypted messengers
* [ ] use email encryption
* [ ] test a new software/service yourself before relying on it
* [ ] block unnecessary Internet connections (PC, Laptop, smartphone)
* [ ] use Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) with text=SMS (okay), software token (good), or hardware token (best)
 * e.g. Authy (software token)
* [ ] use a new email address for every social network
* [ ] use Tor to connect to the Internet

## Privacy Pitch (arguments against people who 'have nothing to hide')
* Do you want to be the weakest point in the system that gets hacked?
* Edward Snowden: “Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.”
